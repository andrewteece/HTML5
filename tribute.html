Adams is wearing a dark jacket and a white shirt, and the open shirt collar is spread over the lapel of his jacket.  He is holding a cable release for the camera, and there is a rocky hillside behind him.  The photo was taken by J. Malcolm Greany, probably in 1947."></a>

Through the doorway and above the wall, an adobe church with white double doors and a similar stair-stepped roof and cross stands, slightly larger than the wall in front of it.
